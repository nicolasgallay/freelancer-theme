description : "
In the past few years, Face Recognition (FR) systems have reached extremely high levels of performance, paving the way to a broader range of applications, where the reliability levels were previously prohibitive to consider automation. This is mainly due to the adoption of deep learning techniques in computer vision. The most adopted paradigm consists in training a network which, from a given image extracts a feature vector which synthetizes the relevant caracteristics of the image. The recognition phase then consists, from two images im1,im2, to predict wether they correspond to the same identity or not. This is done from the extracted features z1,z2.
<br/> In this data challenge, you are ask to train a machine learning model which, from a vector [z1,z2] made of the concatenation of two templates z1 and z2, predict wether or not these two images correspond to the same identity."
